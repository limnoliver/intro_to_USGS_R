# Exercise: Recreate a published figure
# In this exercise, I want you to spend some time looking in the literature
# for figures that use USGS or other publicly available data
# and do your best to try to recreate the figure!

# Some goals of this exercise are to:
# 1. learn that you, too, can make publication-ready figures!
# science is about building off what others have done, sometimes that's 
# being able to apply their methods at your own site, or reproduce their results
# 2. Being able to digest a journal article and find the information you need
# to reproduce results. 
# 3. How to be creative when you might not have all of the information!

# Here are some road bumps you might hit and what you can do:
# 1. The information in the figure doesn't use USGS data. In this case, 
# try to find a nearby USGS gage and use those data! Do they look similar? 
# or see if they published the data, and use that data!
# 2. The figure contains other information that I don't have access to. No worries,
# recreate as much as you can!
# 3. The style of the figure doesn't match the style that I'm producing in R.
# Try to play around with theme() in ggplot to get as close as you can! But this
# is less improtant than trying to show the same information. 

# Tips for finding figures to recreate:
# Search for papers that cite NWIS or dataRetrieval
# good search terms are USGS, river discharge, river water quality, etc.
# here are some papers if you can't find your own:

# Gage height in the Detroit River (Figure 2) from Hilling et al. 2021 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/12/1616
# Temperature and discharge records from Esopus Creek (Figure ) from George et al. 2015 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/fwb.12577
# Cumulative runoff from Putuligayuk River (Figure 5) from Stuefer et al. 2017 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2017WR020567
# (hint, you might need to use the watershed area value reported in Table 1 to get the units right!)
